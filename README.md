# nand2tetris

My solutions to the nand2tetris projects. All are tested and working.
Caveats:
- I skipped ch 9 (the DIY game).
- ch 12 could use a little more debugging and a full heap allocator implementation.

I've only included my source files for clarity's sake. To run this code yourself, download the full nand2tetris repo and copy over my source files.
